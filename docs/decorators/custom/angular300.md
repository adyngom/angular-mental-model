# Angular 300 Bootcamp

Angular is an opinionated and beautiful framework that lately is not gaining the same rate of adoption because of a very clumsy approach into trying to learn and master it.

Angular is definitely not easy but it is not hard if the right expectations are set and someone can be guided incrementally in how to properly level up.

**Angular 300** bootcamp is a thorough program that will focus on in-depth understanding of the various builing blocks of the framework and most importantly will engage you in the quest of mastering all the programming concepts, methodologies and best practices at play that are required to be able to build a solid and reliable modern application regardless of the framework or platform you are using.

We are convinced that this should be the most compelling part of choosing Angular as a primary choice for your journey into the world of web and mobile development. A solid foundation in Angular will expose you to concepts such as:

* S.O.L.I.D. principles
* Dependency Injection
* Modularization
* Separation of Concerns
* Reactive Programming
* Observables
* Strongly Typed Language
* TypeScript Wizardry
* Performance and Performance Tuning
* Architecture Patterns
* Architecting Large Scale Applications
* Unit and Integration Testing
* Component-Based Development
* and optionally: Mono-repo Architecture, Microfrontends and much more.

This might sound like a lot of work and it is, but the real benefit here is not the mastery of a framework but building a solid engineering core that will set you apart in your career.
